<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcutaneous Pacing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Dual Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Triple Chamber Temporary Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The transcutaneous pacing market can be segmented into three main types: Single Chamber Temporary Pacemaker, Dual Chamber Temporary Pacemaker, and Triple Chamber Temporary Pacemaker. The Single Chamber type stimulates one heart chamber, typically the right ventricle, to manage bradycardia. The Dual Chamber variety coordinates pacing for both atrium and ventricle, enhancing synchronized heart activity. The Triple Chamber type, or cardiac resynchronization therapy, targets both ventricles and the atrium, improving overall cardiac function in patients with heart failure.</p></p>
