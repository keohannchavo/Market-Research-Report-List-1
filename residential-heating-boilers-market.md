<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential heating boilers market includes two main types: non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at lower efficiency, expelling flue gases at higher temperatures, which leads to thermal losses. They are generally less expensive and simpler to install. In contrast, condensing boilers are designed to recover heat from exhaust gases, achieving higher efficiency by using lower temperature returns. This makes them more environmentally friendly and cost-effective over time due to energy savings, although they typically involve higher initial costs and complex installations.</p></p>
